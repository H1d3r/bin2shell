## Do you need visible spaces in real-world filename obfuscation?
- Short answer:
    - No, visible spaces aren’t strictly necessary. The invisible Unicode characters alone (like zero-width spaces \u200B) are enough to break up the filename visually and hide the real extension.

    - Why might someone add visible spaces?
    - To make the filename look longer or suspiciously padded, confusing users further.

Some file explorers or systems may collapse or ignore zero-width spaces, so visible spaces make the “gap” more obvious.
It might mimic how some malicious files try to look like normal files but with odd spacing.

- Why you might skip visible spaces:
    - Zero-width spaces are invisible but still break up the filename and fool naive viewers.
- Visible spaces can sometimes make the filename look weird or easier to spot as suspicious.
- Some systems trim trailing spaces in filenames (especially Windows), which may break your trick.
- Less chance of the filename being flagged as “odd” if it’s cleaner.
